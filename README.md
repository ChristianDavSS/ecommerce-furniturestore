# **ECOMMERCE REST-API DEVELOPED WITH SPRINGBOOT**
### I developed a REST API for a ecommerce website (the backend is fully done). I used it with a very basic frontend to test it and it works very well.
### This API was done using Spring Boot and Spring Security with Java 21, using sessions to make the website have a better experience.
## ¿What can i improve?
### In a future I´ll add the JWT instead of sessions, making it a safer experience for users.

# ¡THANK YOU! I hope this repository helps you developing :).
